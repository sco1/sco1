# sco1's Reading List
### *Crafting Interpreters*, Robert Nystrom
https://craftinginterpreters.com/

A book that likely needs no introduction, this was my first foray into building up my general CS knowledge and really sparked my interest in working through these kinds of texts, and even inspired me to work on [ZWOM](https://github.com/sco1/zwom), my minilang for creating Zwift workouts.

You can find my Python tree-walk implementation of `lox` at: [sco1/pylox](https://github.com/sco1/pylox). I still haven't gotten to Part 2 yet üòÅ

### *The Ray Tracer Challenge*, Jamis Buck
https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/

A fun introduction to the concepts behind 3D rendering using ray tracing. Algorithms & tests are language-agnostic, allowing you to follow along in whatever programming language you're most comfortable with!

### *Writing An Interpreter In Go* & *Writing A Compiler In Go*, Thorsten Ball
https://thorstenball.com/books/

In a similar vein as *Crafting Interpreters*, these books walk through the creation of both a tree-walk interpreter and bytecode VM for the `monkey` esolang. I enjoyed using this text as an introduction to the Go programming language.

### *Computer Science From Scratch*, David Kopec
https://nostarch.com/computer-science-from-scratch

Came across this text while reading comments on HN & picked up the Early Access version. The book covers a wide variety of really interesting CS topics, including stochastic painting and hardware emulation. You even get to implement an NES emulator, how cool! Concepts are well explained as you walk through implementation using modern Python (3.12+), and each chapter features exercises that help you explore far beyond the chapter's content.
